# Time Series Forecasting with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) using PyTorch

## Overview

This project implements a Time Series Forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with PyTorch. The goal is to predict future values in a time series based on historical data.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Placeholder for the time series dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and analysis.
  - `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Notebook for time series data preprocessing and exploration.
  - `LSTM_Model_Training.ipynb`: Notebook containing the LSTM model training process.
  - `Time_Series_Predictions.ipynb`: Notebook for making time series predictions.

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the LSTM model.
  - `lstm_model.py`: Python script defining the PyTorch LSTM model.
  - `train.py`: Python script for training the LSTM model.
  - `predict.py`: Python script for making time series predictions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- pandas
- matplotlib
